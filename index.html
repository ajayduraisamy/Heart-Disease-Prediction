                system uses  the CNN algorithm in the prediction
                of chronic the disease.At first, the <br> data set is  
                converted into vector form, followed  by word    
                embedding to adopt zero values for filling the  
                data. It is then  given to <br> the convolution layer
                The symptoms of an individual along with the age and
                gender can be given to the ML model to further<br> process. 
                After preliminary processing of the data, the ML model uses 
                the current input, trains and tests the algorithm resulting <br>
                in the predicted disease. Fig. 2 Proposed system flow diagram
